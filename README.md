# MNIST-Neural-Network-with-Tensorflow
Code that shows how to make a simple neural network to classify handwritten digits using Tensorflow. This uses the widely known MNIST dataset.  
I would be glad to help anyone if I can, hopefully this code can help as a guide to some.
This code was written relatively quickly so if someone finds a way to streamline it, then go for it, it'd be cool to see.
